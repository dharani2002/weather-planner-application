**Client Name:** Casual Project for Personal Use

**Problem Statement:**

### Project Overview
Hello! I’m looking to have a personalized weather and task planning application developed. The idea is simple yet practical – a web app that not only shows the current weather and forecasts for my location but also lets me plan my activities based on the weather conditions. This app will be my "Weather Companion" for daily and weekly planning, with a bit of personalization to make it more useful and intuitive for me. Here’s a breakdown of what I’m envisioning.

### Key Requirements

1. **Weather Information Display**
   - **Current Weather**: Show me the current temperature, weather conditions (sunny, rainy, etc.), and basic details like humidity, wind speed, etc.
   - **Hourly & Weekly Forecast**: I’d like to see a breakdown of what to expect throughout the day and the upcoming week.
   - **Interactive Graph**: It would be great if there’s a visual element, like a graph or chart, to show temperature changes over the day or week.

2. **Location Detection and Selection**
   - **Automatic Location**: When I open the app, it should detect my current location automatically and show the weather for that area.
   - **Location Change Option**: I’d also like the option to manually search for and select different locations (for example, if I want to check the weather in another city).
   - **Location Display**: The selected location should be clearly displayed at the top of the app, and I should be able to change it whenever I want.

3. **Task Planning Based on Weather**
   - **To-Do List**: I’d like to have a simple to-do list integrated, where I can add tasks I’m planning to do on specific days or weekends.
   - **Weather-Linked Planning**: The app should allow me to manage my to-dos with the weather in mind. For instance, I might want to schedule outdoor activities on sunny days.
   - **Saving Tasks**: I’d prefer my tasks to be saved even if I close the app so that I don’t have to re-enter them each time.

4. **Date Input for Specific Weather**
   - **Future Forecast**: Sometimes, I may want to know the weather for a particular future date. There should be an option to select a date to view the forecast for that specific day (if available).

5. **Additional Features**
   - **Cookies for Preferences**: It would be helpful if the app remembers some of my settings (like my preferred temperature unit or location) even if I haven’t saved them as tasks.
   - **Map Display**: If possible, a small map showing my selected location would add a nice touch, so I can see where I am or where I’m checking the weather for.
   - **Multiple Sources**: I’d like the app to use reliable weather data from multiple sources, if possible, to give the most accurate forecast.
   - **Date and Input Validation**: To keep things smooth, ensure that only valid dates and inputs are processed by the app.

### Goals
Overall, I want a simple yet functional weather and task app that I can open to quickly check the weather and organize my day around it. This app should be straightforward and visually clear, focusing on delivering information efficiently and allowing me to plan effectively. 

### Notes
I’m not looking for anything too complex or heavily detailed; this is just a personal project to make my daily planning a bit easier and more weather-aware. I’m open to any suggestions for making it more practical and user-friendly. Thank you!
